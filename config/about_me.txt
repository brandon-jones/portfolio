I am a Husband, Father, and Developer. In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, fixing things around the house and learning new programming skills and techniques. 

First serious programming was in .NET while still in college in between my other classes. Now I spend most of my time in Ruby on Rails. I am picked this languaged beucase it is what my currnet job uses. I like to remain open to the idea of new languages and as I get better at Rails I will devote more time to learning other languages. I never want to be known as "The <*insert programming langauge here*> Guy"

I graduated college from California State University of Bakersfield in the summer of 2013 eaning my Computer Infomration Systems Degree.
