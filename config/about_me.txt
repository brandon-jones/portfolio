I am a Husband, Father, and Developer. In my free time I enjoy spending time with my family, fixing things around the house and learning new programming skills and techniques. 

First serious programming was in .NET while still in college in between my other classes. Now I spend most of my time in Ruby on Rails. I am picked this languaged beucase it is what my currnet job uses. I like to remain open to the idea of new languages and as I get better at Rails I will devote more time to learning other languages. I never want to be known as "The <*insert programming langauge here*> Guy"

I graduated college from California State University of Bakersfield in the summer of 2013 eaning my Computer Infomration Systems Degree. 

Currently I work for Lightspeed Systems out of the Bakersfield California Office. I started as tech support while still in college moving up to QA after a year and a half. After a year in QA (and getting my degree) I became a programmer in late 2012. I currenlty work on their Mobile Manager project and their My Big Campus product. It is great being able to jump in between to two projects since they are so different.
